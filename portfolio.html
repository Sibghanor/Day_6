             <blockquote>
                <p>"Sometimes, we are heartbroken because we are holding onto things and people that were never meant to be ours.
                     True healing begins when we let go of these attachments and reconnect with our own hearts, understanding
                     that our worth is not dependent on others."
                 </p>
